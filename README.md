# RobotAdvisor-for-MetaTrader-4
This bot helps to automate the process of placing orders in the MetaTrader 4 program

In the process of creating this program, I mastered:
- MQL4
- Creating a Greek interface
- Automatic placing of orders
- Getting information from graphs

### How to install
The first option:
1. Download the `roboExpert.ex4` file to your computer and transfer it to a folder `...\MQL4\Experts`
2. Restart MetaTrader
3. Drag the roboExpert Expert Advisor from the Navigator panel to the chart in the trading terminal

The second option:
1. Download the `roboExpert.mq4` file into folder `...\MQL4\Experts` and compile it in MetaEditor 4
2. If the text on your computer does not look as it should, try reducing or increasing the TS constant in the `roboExpert.mq4` file
3. See point 2 in the first option
